FONT INFORMATION
==========================================================================
All akaType™ fonts currently released are free for use in your projects
whether personal or commercial in nature. You may use images created using
the fonts in any way you wish. You may give copies of the font files to
anyone you wish so long as the restrictions listed below are adhered to.
The only real restrictions I have on their use and/or redistribution is
that:

    1. You may not sell the actual font files, singly; nor include the font
files in a collection of fonts which will be sold.
    2. You may not bundle the font files with software which is to be sold,
nor require anyone to buy something in order to receive the font files.
    3. I require that my trademarks be respected (i.e. authorship and font
names may not be stripped from the font files themselves).

Currently there are eleven (11) akaType™ fonts:
    akaArcade™
    akaChen™
    akaDora™
    akaDylan™ Plain,
